Run Map
------------
Some html and JavaScript that maps out a run.

Details:
After calculating you're LatLong position, it finds a random point 1/3 of your run-length away from you.
Then it plots another point 60 degress to either side, and finally connects the three points to complete your run.


Please fork or email suggestions!
